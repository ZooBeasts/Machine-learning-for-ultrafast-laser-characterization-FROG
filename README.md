--------------------------------------------------------

This is the collaboration project for ultrafast laser pulse response prediction between Heriot-Watt University and the University of St Andrews 

This is the mock code for the paper. During to the shape of FROG traces are easy regonized, thus using the encoder-decoder model performs roughly the same as using Resnet9. 
The code is shared so people can do similar projects without trouble. if you like our project, please reference our paper.

How to use: 

Dataholder has single input and dual input dataset.

Train Single only uses one inpout

Train Dual uses two input

Prediction Dual Dataset predicts pulse from dataset selection

Prediction Dual Specific predicts pulse from selected data.
